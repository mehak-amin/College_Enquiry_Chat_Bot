Chatbot Project Notes

1. Utility Functions (nltk_utils.py):
   - Import necessary libraries and modules:
     - numpy: For numerical operations
     - nltk: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing

   - Tokenization - tokenize function:
     - Split a sentence into an array of words/tokens using nltk's word_tokenize.

   - Stemming - stem function:
     - Apply stemming to a word using nltk's PorterStemmer.
     - Convert the word to lowercase before stemming.

   - Bag of Words - bag_of_words function:
     - Create a bag of words representation for a tokenized sentence.
     - Initialize a bag array with 0s for each word.
     - Set bag elements to 1 if words in sentence match the vocabulary.

2. Model Definition (model.py):
   - Import necessary module:
     - torch.nn: PyTorch's neural network components

   - Define custom NeuralNet class:
     - Inherit from nn.Module, the base class for PyTorch neural network modules.

   - Initialization - __init__ method:
     - Constructor takes input_size, hidden_size, and num_classes.
     - Define layers l1, l2, and l3 as linear (fully connected) layers.
     - Initialize ReLU activation function.

   - Forward Propagation - forward method:
     - Forward pass through the layers with ReLU activations in between.
     - Output does not have additional activation or softmax.

3. Data Preprocessing and Training (Training File):
   - Import necessary libraries and modules:
     - numpy: For numerical operations
     - json: For handling JSON data
     - torch: PyTorch for building and training the neural network
     - torch.nn, torch.utils.data: PyTorch components for neural networks and data loading
     - Custom utility modules: nltk_utils (for text preprocessing), model (for NeuralNet model)

   - Load intents data from JSON:
     - Read "intensts.json" using the json library.

   - Initialize empty lists for words, tags, and (patterns, tags) pairs:
     - These lists will store information about the data and intent tags.

   - Loop through each intent in intents data:
     - Extract tag and add it to tags list.
     - Loop through patterns in the intent and tokenize the patterns.
     - Extend all_words list with tokenized words and add (words, tag) pairs to xy list.

   - Perform preprocessing on words:
     - Remove duplicates, sort, and perform stemming on all_words.
     - Sort and store unique tags.

   - Create training data arrays:
     - Iterate through (pattern, tag) pairs in xy.
     - Create bag of words representation for each pattern.
     - Convert tags to numerical labels.

   - Define hyperparameters:
     - Set values for num_epochs, batch_size, learning_rate, input_size, hidden_size, and output_size.

   - Define custom ChatDataset class:
     - Create a class to handle dataset loading using PyTorch's Dataset class.
     - Implement __init__, __getitem__, and __len__ methods.

   - Create DataLoader for training:
     - Initialize DataLoader with defined batch_size and other settings.

   - Determine device (GPU or CPU) for training.

   - Create an instance of NeuralNet model:
     - Instantiate NeuralNet with input_size, hidden_size, and output_size.
     - Move the model to the selected device.

   - Define loss function and optimizer:
     - Use CrossEntropyLoss and Adam optimizer.

   - Training loop:
     - Iterate over epochs.
     - For each batch of data, perform forward pass, calculate loss, backward pass, and optimization.

   - Save trained model data:
     - Create a dictionary containing model_state, input_size, hidden_size, output_size, all_words, and tags.
     - Save the dictionary as "data.pth" using torch.save.





4. Chat Interaction and Response Generation (chat.py):
   - Import necessary libraries and modules:
     - random: For selecting random responses
     - json: For loading intent data
     - torch: PyTorch for loading model and making predictions

   - Custom Module Imports:
     - Import NeuralNet model and utility functions from custom modules

   - Check GPU Availability:
     - Determine if GPU is available for running the model.

   - Load Intents Data:
     - Load intent data from "intensts.json" using json.load.

   - Load Model Data:
     - Load previously saved model data from "data.pth".

   - Extract Model Parameters:
     - Extract input_size, hidden_size, output_size, vocabulary, tags, and model_state from loaded data.

   - Create Model Instance:
     - Instantiate NeuralNet model and load model_state.
     - Move the model to the device.

   - Model Evaluation Mode:
     - Set the model to evaluation mode to disable certain layers like dropout.

   - Fallback Responses:
     - Define fallback responses for low-confidence cases.

   - Response Generation - get_response function:
     - Tokenize user input and create a bag of words representation.
     - Forward pass through the model to get predictions.
     - Choose responses based on confidence and intent tags.

   - Main Interaction Loop:
     - Start an interaction loop to chat with the bot.
     - Take user input and pass it to get_response function.
     - Print bot's response along with its name.

5. Usage Instructions:
   - Place the training file, utility files, model definition, and chat file in the same directory.
   - Run the training file to train the chatbot model.
   - After training, run the chat file to interact with the chatbot.
